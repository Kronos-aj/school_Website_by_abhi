Ans 1-  We use <div> tag to create section of content to be formatted with style sheet.
     we can use <section> tag but for styling purpose we should prefer <div> tag instead.


Ans 2- a-Attribute is a term we used in HTML, where as Propert is term that belongs to DOM.
       b-Attribute is a quality or additonal feature belonging to a tag or element, where as
         Property is a characteristic of an object corresponding to a DOM.
       c-The value or feature of an attribute can't be changed but the value of property can be changed.
       d-The attributes role is basicaly to initalize the DOM property.
       e-we can't use angular bindings with attributes but we can use it with DOM.

Ans 3- The main difference between var keyword and let keyword is that, Varibles intialised using
       var keywords are globally accesseble regardless of the block scope. Where as the variables
       initalised using the let keyword is stricted to the block in which it is intalised.

Ans 4- We use ";"(semicolon) to end an statement in javascript.

Ans 5- The advantages of javascript are as follows:-
	1- It is easy to learn for a new programmer.
	2- Debugging and testing is comparatively easier in it.
	3- Syntax are simpler to understand.
	4- It is comparatively faster then other languages. 
Ans 6- There are different ways to declare a variable in javascript:-
         1- 'var':- Var is a function scoped keyword used to declare a varible globally.
         2- 'let':- Let is blocked scope. It strcits the scope of the declared varible to the active block only in which it is declared.
         3- 'const':- Const is only used when we know that a variable is not declared again.
	  TYPES OF VARIABLES:- (Data Types)
	  1- String.
	  2- Number.
	  3- Boolean.
	  4- Null.
	  5- Undefined.

	  1- if condition is used in javascript. It is executed when the code or statement is true.
	  2- else condition is executed when the statement is false.
	  3- Nested if-else condition is executed when we need to apply more conditon.
	  4- switch statement is used when there are more alternative case corresponding to a particular statement are there, 
	     it is used along with 'break' keyword after each case.
	 example:-
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<title> CA conditional statement</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<h2> conditon using if else </h2>
	<script>
	var x;
	for (n = 0; x < 6; n++)
	{
	if(x == 4)	
	{
	document.write("the value of x is 4");
	break;
	}
	else if(x==2){
	document.write("the value of x is 2");
	}
	}
	</script>	
	</body>
	</html>

Ans 8- Div tag is a tag used in html to separate data in a web page and also to create a particular section for a particular data.
